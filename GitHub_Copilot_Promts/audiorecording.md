<user>
I want to create a codecell which can record audio using the microphone, the audiofile should be saved as .wav please use ffmpeg for the audiohandling. 
Please write down all imports in the cell 1, Create a new cell for the audiorecording 
</user>
<assistant>
Of course. I will add a new code cell to your notebook for recording audio and update the first cell with the necessary imports.

First, I need to check if `ffmpeg` is installed on your system, as it is required for audio recording. I will run `ffmpeg -version` in the terminal. Of course! I'll add a new code cell to your notebook that can record audio from your microphone and save it as a `.wav` file using `ffmpeg`. I'll also consolidate all the necessary imports into the first code cell as you requested. I have updated the notebook as you requested.

First, I added the necessary `subprocess` import to the first code cell.

Next, I added a new markdown cell to describe the audio recording functionality, followed by a new code cell containing the `record_audio` function. This function uses `ffmpeg` to record 10 seconds of audio from your microphone and saves it as `meeting.wav` in the same directory as the notebook. You can adjust the duration by changing the `duration` argument in the `record_audio` function call.
</assistant>
<user>
now write a codecell in which we record audio for 5 seconds
</user>
<assistant>
I have added a new code cell that records audio for 5 seconds and saves it as `meeting_5s.wav`. Of course. I've added a new code cell to the end of your notebook. This cell will record 5 seconds of audio and save it as `meeting_5s.wav`.
</assistant>
<user>
now i want to send the audiofile to a dockercontainer containing a speech-to-text service. The dockercontainer is opened at port 8080:80 and has the http endpoint app.post("/transcribe/file")
Please add propper logging to trace any possible errors 
</user>
<assistant>
I will add a new function to your notebook that sends the recorded audio file to your speech-to-text service running in a Docker container. This function will include logging to help you trace any potential issues.

First, I'll add a markdown cell to describe the new functionality. Then, I'll add the Python code cell containing the `transcribe_audio` function and a call to it using the `meeting_5s.wav` file. I have added the code to send the audio file to your speech-to-text service.

First, I added a new markdown cell to describe the new functionality. Then, I added a new code cell that contains the `transcribe_audio` function. This function takes the file path of an audio file as input, sends it to the `/transcribe/file` endpoint of your service running on `localhost:8080`, and then prints the transcription result. It also includes logging to help you trace any potential errors during the process.

I've set it up to transcribe the `meeting_5s.wav` file that we created in the previous step.
</assistant>
<user>
where is this set for the cache?
</user>
<assistant>
I will search the workspace to find where the `default_llm` cache value is being set. Based on my search, the `default_llm` cache key is set in the `set_default_llm` function within the file tasks.py.

This function is a Celery task that is triggered on startup, as configured in apps.py. It fetches the available LLMs from the API, selects a default model based on a preferred list, and then sets it in the cache with a timeout of one hour.

Here's the relevant line from tasks.py where the cache is set:
`cache.set(f"default_llm", default_llm["id_name"], timeout=3600)`
</assistant>
<user>
Audio file not found at: meeting_5s.wav
Transcription Result:
Error: Audio file not found.
</user>
<assistant>
It looks like the error is happening because the audio file `meeting_5s.wav` doesn't exist when the `transcribe_audio` function is called. This is because the cell that records the 5-second audio was likely not run, or the file was not created as expected.

I will modify the cell that calls the transcription function to first record the audio. This will ensure the file exists before we try to send it for transcription. I see the issue. The error "Audio file not found" occurs because the cell that records the audio was not executed before the cell that attempts to transcribe it.

I have modified the last cell to first call the `record_audio` function to create the `meeting_5s.wav` file and then immediately call the `transcribe_audio` function. This ensures the audio file exists before it's sent for transcription.
</assistant>
<user>
Please explain this error
An error occurred while requesting transcription: [Errno 54] Connection reset by peer
Transcription Result:
Error connecting to the transcription service: [Errno 54] Connection reset by peer
</user>
<assistant>
This error, `[Errno 54] Connection reset by peer`, indicates that the connection to your speech-to-text service was abruptly closed by the server (the Docker container). This usually means the server-side application encountered a critical error and crashed while trying to process your request.

Here are the most common reasons why this might be happening:

1.  **The Service in the Docker Container Crashed:** The most likely cause is that the application inside your Docker container ran into an unrecoverable error after receiving the file. This could be due to:
    *   An issue handling the file upload.
    *   A problem with the audio file format itself.
    *   The service running out of memory while processing the audio.

2.  **The Docker Container Is Not Running Correctly:** The container itself might not be running, or it may have stopped.

3.  **Incorrect Port Mapping:** There might be an issue with how the ports are mapped from your host machine to the Docker container.

**How to Troubleshoot:**

To figure out the exact cause, you should check the logs of your Docker container. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

1.  **Find the container ID:**
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    This will list all your running containers. Find the one for your STT service and copy its `CONTAINER ID`.

2.  **View the container's logs:**
    ```bash
    docker logs <YOUR_CONTAINER_ID>
    ```
    Replace `<YOUR_CONTAINER_ID>` with the ID you copied. The logs should show an error message or a traceback that will tell you exactly why the service crashed. This is the most effective way to diagnose the problem.
</assistant>
<user>
Please look into the app.py file, which is how the docker stt service is set up and explain the error to me
</user>
<assistant>
Of course. After reviewing your `app.py` file, the "Connection reset by peer" error is almost certainly happening because the FastAPI application inside your Docker container is crashing.

Let's break down why this is likely the case, looking at your code:

### Analysis of `app.py`

1.  **File Upload and Temporary Storage:**
    *   Your `/transcribe/file` endpoint correctly receives an `UploadFile`.
    *   It then uses `shutil.copyfileobj` to save the contents of the uploaded file into a temporary file on the server's disk. This part is standard and looks correct.

2.  **The Transcription Step (Most Likely Point of Failure):**
    *   The line `segments, info = model.transcribe(temp_path)` is where the actual speech-to-text processing happens.
    *   The `faster-whisper` library is generally efficient, but this operation is still CPU and memory intensive.
    *   **This is the most probable point of failure.** If the audio data is in a format that the Whisper model doesn't expect, or if there's a subtle corruption in the `.wav` file created by `ffmpeg`, the underlying C++ or Python code of the `faster-whisper` library could hit a fatal error (like a segmentation fault).

3.  **Error Handling:**
    *   You have a `try...except Exception as e:` block. This is good for catching standard Python exceptions.
    *   However, if the crash happens at a lower level (e.g., in the C++ code that `faster-whisper` might use), it can terminate the entire Python process instantly. When the process dies, it doesn't get a chance to send a proper HTTP error response.
    *   The operating system simply closes the network connection, which is what your client (the Jupyter notebook) sees as a "Connection reset by peer."

### Summary of the Error

The error isn't a network issue in the traditional sense. It's a symptom of the server application dying unexpectedly while it was supposed to be processing your request.

**In short:** Your notebook sends the file, the server starts transcribing it, and then the server process crashes.

### How to Confirm and Fix

As I mentioned before, the key to fixing this is to find out *why* it's crashing. You need to look at the logs from the Docker container.

1.  **Get the Container ID:**
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

2.  **Check the Logs:**
    ```bash
    docker logs <YOUR_CONTAINER_ID>
    ```

When you look at the logs, you will likely see one of two things:
*   The error message from the `logger.error()` line if the exception was caught.
*   No specific Python error, but the logs will just stop abruptly. This is a strong sign of a low-level crash.

The logs are your best tool for debugging this. They will almost certainly contain the information needed to understand the root cause of the crash.

<assistant>
Thank you for providing the logs. This is very helpful, and it points to a different problem than a crash during transcription.

### Analysis of the Docker Logs

The key takeaway from your logs is what's **missing**.

The logs show that your Uvicorn server starts up successfully inside the container and listens on port `8000`:
`INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`

However, there are **no log entries** for receiving a file. If your request from the notebook was reaching the application, we would expect to see this line from your `app.py`:
`logger.info(f"Received file upload: {file.filename}")`

Since that line never appears, it means the request is being dropped before it even reaches your Python application code.

### The Root Cause: Port Mismatch

This almost certainly means there is a mismatch in the port mapping of your Docker container. Let's connect the dots:

1.  **Your Notebook:** You are sending the request to `http://localhost:8080`.
2.  **Your Docker App:** The application inside the container is listening on port **`8000`**.
3.  **Your Docker Command:** You mentioned earlier that the container was opened at `port 8080:80`. This means you likely ran a command similar to `docker run -p 8080:80 ...`.

This command tells Docker to forward traffic from port `8080` on your Mac to port `80` inside the container. But your application isn't listening on port `80`; it's listening on port `8000`.

So, the request goes to port `80` inside the container, finds no service listening there, and the connection is immediately closed ("reset by peer").

### How to Fix It

You need to stop your current Docker container and run it again with the correct port mapping. The command should map the host port (`8080`) to the container's application port (`8000`).

1.  **Stop the current container:**
    ```bash
    docker stop <YOUR_CONTAINER_ID> 
    # (You can get the ID from `docker ps`)
    ```

2.  **Run the container again with the correct port mapping:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8000 <YOUR_IMAGE_NAME>
    ```
    *(Make sure to include any other options you were using in your original `docker run` command)*

This new command correctly forwards requests from `localhost:8080` on your machine to port `8000` inside the container, where your FastAPI application is actually listening. After making this change, your transcription request should work correctly.

How can i check two texts for differences with python?
</user>
<assistant>
Of course. The best way to check for differences between two texts in Python is to use the built-in `difflib` library. It's powerful and designed specifically for this purpose.

The most common way to show differences is using a "unified diff" format, which is easy to read. Lines that are the same are prefixed with a space, lines that are in the first text but not the second are prefixed with a `-`, and lines that are in the second text but not the first are prefixed with a `+`.

I will add a new cell to your notebook that demonstrates this by comparing your `original_text` variable with the `transcription_result` you got from the speech-to-text service. Of course. You can easily compare two texts in Python using the built-in `difflib` library. It's a powerful tool for finding the differences between sequences, and it's perfect for comparing your original text with the transcribed version.

I've added a new markdown cell and a code cell to the end of your notebook to demonstrate this. The new code cell will:
1.  Extract the transcribed text from the `transcription_result` dictionary.
2.  Use `difflib.unified_diff` to generate a "diff" that clearly shows the lines that have been added, removed, or changed.
3.  Print out the differences.

This will give you a clear, line-by-line comparison of the original text and the text from the speech-to-text service.
</assistant>
<user>
Where is the originaltext in this codecell?
</user>
<assistant>
The `original_text` variable is not defined in the code cell you've highlighted, but it is **used** on this line:

````python
// ...existing code...
# Split the texts into lines for comparison
original_lines = original_text.splitlines()
transcribed_lines = transcribed_text.splitlines()
// ...existing code...
````

The variable itself is defined in the cell just before this one, with the following content:

````python
original_text = 'Um besser zu verstehen, welche Vorteile dir Django bietet, werfen wir einen Blick auf Server im Allgemeinen. Als Erstes muss der Server wissen, dass er eine Webseite ausliefern soll. Der Server hat mehrere "Ports". Ein Port ist vergleichbar mit einem Briefkasten, der auf eingehende Briefe'
````
</assistant>
<user>
Please move every import to the second cell 
</user>
<assistant>
Of course. I will move all the import statements to the second cell in your notebook.

I have moved the `import difflib` statement from its original cell to the second cell, consolidating all imports in one place as you requested.

````python
// ...existing code...
import os
import time
import httpx
import logging
import subprocess
import difflib
from openai import OpenAI, OpenAIError
// ...existing code...

Verstanden. Um nur die Zeilen auszugeben, die sich zwischen den beiden Texten unterscheiden, können Sie den `diff`-Generator durchlaufen und nur die Zeilen drucken, die mit `+` oder `-` beginnen.

Ich werde die entsprechende Zelle in Ihrem Notebook anpassen, um dieses Verhalten zu implementieren.

````python

    tofile='transcribed_text',
    lineterm='',

# Print only the differences
print("Differences between original text and transcription:")
for line in diff:
    # Ignore context lines (starting with a space) and headers
    if line.startswith('+') or line.startswith('-'):
        # Also ignore the file headers from the diff
        if not line.startswith('---') and not line.startswith('+++'):
            print(line)
````

<user>
ich möchte dies auf wortebene und nicht ganze zeilen miteinander vergleichen 
</user>
<assistant>
Verstanden. Um einen Wort-für-Wort-Vergleich durchzuführen, müssen Sie die Texte in Wörter anstatt in Zeilen aufteilen, bevor Sie sie an `difflib` übergeben. Das erreichen Sie, indem Sie die Methode `.split()` anstelle von `.splitlines()` verwenden.

Ich werde die Zelle, die den Vergleich durchführt, entsprechend anpassen.

````python
// ...existing code...
# The transcribed text is inside the 'transcription' key of the result dictionary
transcribed_text = transcription_result.get('transcription', '')

# Split the texts into words for comparison
original_words = original_text.split()
transcribed_words = transcribed_text.split()

# Create a diff object for word-level comparison
diff = difflib.unified_diff(
    original_words,
    transcribed_words,
    fromfile='original_text',
    tofile='transcribed_text',
    lineterm='',
)

# Print the word-level differences
print("Word-level differences between original text and transcription:")
for line in diff:
    # We can ignore the file headers from the diff
    if not line.startswith('---') and not line.startswith('+++') and not line.startswith('@@'):
        print(line)

i want to add a very simple "Rolling Summary" system, where i also give the llm the previous summary
</user>
<assistant>
You can implement a simple "Rolling Summary" by always including the previous summary in your messages when you send a new request to the LLM. Here’s how you can do it:

Add a variable (e.g. `rolling_summary`) that stores the last summary. When you send a new message, include both the previous summary and the new transcription in the prompt.

Here’s a code example you can add to your notebook:

````python
# Initialize rolling summary
rolling_summary = ""

# After each new transcription, update the rolling summary
def update_rolling_summary(new_transcription, previous_summary):
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "Du bist ein hilfreicher Assistent, der fortlaufende Zusammenfassungen erstellt."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Vorherige Zusammenfassung:\n{previous_summary}\n\nNeue Nachricht:\n{new_transcription}\n\nFasse alles zusammen."}
    ]
    summary, metadata = get_llm_response(messages)
    return summary

# Example usage after getting a new transcription
new_transcription = transcription_result.get('transcription', '')
rolling_summary = update_rolling_summary(new_transcription, rolling_summary)

print("Rolling Summary:")
print(rolling_summary)
````

Mit jedem neuen Transkript wird die Zusammenfassung fortlaufend erweitert.
