## 🔗 How Components Are Connected

- **settings.py**: Registers all Django apps, configures logging, DB, Celery, etc.
- **urls.py**: Routes API endpoints to each app (search, mail, contacts, agent, etc.).
- **accounts/**: Handles authentication for all API endpoints, manages user/tenant context.
- **agent/**: Provides AI-powered features (LLM, chat, search tools) used by mail, search, and other apps.
- **mail/**: Integrates with Microsoft via `microsoft/`, uses agent for priority/reply/writing.
- **search/**: Centralized search index, hybrid search (BM25 + vector), used by agent and mail.
- **contacts/** and **crm/**: Provide user/contact/company data for mail and agent features.
- **Celery**: Handles async tasks (email processing, AI jobs) via `celery.py` and worker containers.
- **Docs**: Markdown guides for onboarding, OAuth, LLM integration, rule management, etc.

---

## 🐳 Docker Compose Architecture

- **docker-compose.dev.yml / local.yml**: Orchestrate containers for:
  - **backend**: Django API server
  - **celery_worker**: Async task processing
  - **celery_beat**: Scheduled tasks
  - **pg_search**: PostgreSQL + ParadeDB (vector search)
  - **redis**: Message broker/cache
  - **nginx-proxy**: SSL termination/reverse proxy
  - **infinity_vectorizer**: Text embedding service for semantic search
  - **pgadmin**: DB admin interface

---

## 📈 Data & Feature Flow

1. **User interacts via Outlook Add-in (frontend)**
2. **Frontend calls backend API endpoints (mail, search, agent)**
3. **Backend authenticates user, determines tenant context**
4. **Mail/Agent/Search apps process requests, use AI/LLM for prioritization, reply, writing**
5. **Search system indexes and retrieves data using hybrid search**
6. **Celery handles background tasks (email sync, AI jobs)**
7. **Results returned to frontend for user display**

## 📚 Documentation

- docs/tenant_onboarding_guide.md: Multi-tenancy onboarding
- docs/microsoft_oauth_authentication.md: OAuth/Graph API setup
- llm_agent_search_integration_implementation_plan.md: LLM agent search integration
- natural_language_rule_management_system.md: Rule management system

---

**Summary:**  
The backend is a modular Django project, with each feature (auth, AI, mail, search, contacts, CRM) in its own app. Everything is orchestrated via Docker Compose for scalable, production-ready deployment. AI/LLM features are deeply integrated for smart email prioritization and productivity.

**Summary:**  
settings.py is the central configuration for your Django backend. It controls security, installed apps, middleware, database, authentication, API docs, caching, logging, integrations, async tasks, and more—using environment variables for secrets and deployment flexibility. This file ensures your backend is modular, secure, scalable, and ready for production.

<user>
is the voice app part of the installed apps?
</user>
<assistant>
No, the `voice` app is **not** listed in the `INSTALLED_APPS` section of your settings.py file.  
Only apps explicitly listed in `INSTALLED_APPS` are active in your Django project. If you want to use the `voice` app, you need to add it to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
</assistant>
<user>
how can i add it to installed apps?
</user>
<assistant>
To add the `voice` app to your Django project, include its dotted path in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your settings.py file.

For example, if your app is at `backend/voice/`, add `"voice"` to the list:

````python
# ...existing code...
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "encrypted_model_fields",
    "drf_yasg",
    "corsheaders",
    "rest_framework",
    "rest_framework_simplejwt",
    "django_filters",
    "rest_framework_simplejwt.token_blacklist",
    "usermanagement",
    "agent.chat",
    "channels",
    "mail.django_mailbox",
    "mail.ai_prio",
    "mail.ai_reply",
    "agent.llm",
    "contacts",
    "microsoft.apps.MicrosoftConfig",
    "django_celery_beat",
    "django_celery_results",
    "crm",
    "django.contrib.sites",
    "allauth",
    "allauth.account",
    "allauth.socialaccount",
    "allauth.socialaccount.providers.microsoft",
    "accounts",
    "search.apps.SearchConfig",
    "voice",  # <-- Add this line
]
# ...existing code...
````

Make sure the `voice` directory contains an `__init__.py` file so Django recognizes it as a Python package.

<user>
Explain to me how the urls.py works and whats its purpose. Please give examples when explaining the functions
</user>
<assistant>
The urls.py file in Django is responsible for **routing incoming HTTP requests to the correct view functions or classes**. It acts as a map between URL patterns and the logic that should handle those requests.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Imports**
   - Imports Django’s URL routing tools (`path`, `include`).
   - Imports views from various apps (e.g., `voice.views.TranscribeAudioView` for speech-to-text).

2. **Router Setup**
   - Uses `rest_framework_nested.routers` to create RESTful API routes for viewsets.
   - Example:  
     ```
     router.register(r'users', user_views.UserViewSet, basename='user')
     ```
     This means requests to users are handled by `UserViewSet`.

3. **Schema & Documentation**
   - Sets up Swagger and Redoc endpoints for interactive API docs:
     ```
     path('swagger/', schema_view.with_ui('swagger', cache_timeout=0), name='schema-swagger-ui')
     path('redoc/', schema_view.with_ui('redoc', cache_timeout=0), name='schema-redoc')
     ```

4. **Custom API Endpoints**
   - Directly maps URLs to specific views:
     ```
     path('api/stt/transcribe/', TranscribeAudioView.as_view(), name='transcribe-audio')
     ```
     Requests to `/api/stt/transcribe/` are handled by the speech-to-text view.

   - JWT authentication endpoints:
     ```
     path('api/token/', TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name='token_obtain_pair')
     path('api/token/refresh/', TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token_refresh')
     ```

5. **Including Other URLconfs**
   - Uses `include()` to pull in routes from other apps:
     ```
     path('contacts/', include('contacts.urls'))
     path('crm/', include('crm.urls'))
     ```
     This means all URLs defined in urls.py are available under `/contacts/`.

6. **Static & Media Files**
   - In development (`DEBUG=True`), serves media files:
     ```
     urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
     ```

---

## **Purpose**

- **Centralizes URL routing** for the whole Django project.
- **Connects URLs to views** so users and clients can interact with your backend.
- **Organizes API endpoints** for REST, authentication, documentation, and features.

---

## **Example**

- Visiting `/admin/` loads the Django admin site.
- Sending a POST to `/api/stt/transcribe/` triggers the speech-to-text transcription logic.
- Accessing `/contacts/` uses all routes defined in `contacts/urls.py`.

---

**Summary:**  
`urls.py` is the entry point for all HTTP requests, mapping them to the correct logic and organizing your backend’s API structure.---
