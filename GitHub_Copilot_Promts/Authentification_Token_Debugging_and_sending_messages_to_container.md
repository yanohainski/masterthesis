# Testing Voice Functionality Without Authentication

There are a few ways to test your voice functionality without requiring authentication:

## Option 1: Create a Testing View with AllowAny Permission

You can create a dedicated testing endpoint for your voice functionality with custom permissions:

```python
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from rest_framework.permissions import AllowAny
from rest_framework.response import Response

@api_view(['POST'])
@permission_classes([AllowAny])
def test_voice_endpoint(request):
    # Call your voice processing logic here
    # This is just an example implementation
    return Response({"status": "success", "message": "Voice test completed"})
```

Then add this URL to your voice app's URLs:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # Your existing URLs
    path('test/', views.test_voice_endpoint, name='test-voice'),
]
```

## Option 2: Use Django's Test Client in a Management Command

Create a custom management command that uses Django's test client:

```python
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from django.test import Client

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Test voice functionality without authentication'

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        client = Client()
        # Prepare test data
        test_data = {
            'audio_file': open('path/to/test/audio.mp3', 'rb'),
            # Add any other required parameters
        }
        
        response = client.post('/api/voice/endpoint/', test_data)
        self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS(f'Response: {response.json()}'))
```

Run it with:
```
python manage.py test_voice
```

## Option 3: Temporarily Modify Settings During Development

For local development only, you could temporarily modify your voice views to bypass authentication:

```python
import os
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated, AllowAny

class VoiceViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    # ...
    
    def get_permissions(self):
        if os.getenv('ENVIRONMENT') == 'local':
            return [AllowAny()]
        return [IsAuthenticated()]
```

Remember to remove these modifications before deploying to production environments!

I need to look at the `tasks.py` file and your voice models to better understand the issue. Let me first check the content of these files. 
</assistant>
<user>
@agent Try Again
</user>
<assistant>
Based on my analysis of the code and logs, I've identified several issues with your voice functionality that could be causing problems. Let me provide solutions and implement them:

## Issues and Solutions:

1. **Authentication Requirement**: Your voice API requires authentication, making testing difficult
2. **Docker Container Connectivity**: Your tasks.py is trying to connect to `http://localhost:8000` but should be using the service name from docker-compose (`voice-stt`)
3. **No
</assistant>
<user>
Can i just comment out the "permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]" line for testing reasons?
</user>
<assistant>
Yes, you can safely comment out the `permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]` line for testing purposes. In fact, the code in your file already has this line commented out:

```python
parser_classes = [MultiPartParser, FormParser] #Wandelt Daten um in lesbare Formate
#permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated] #Authentifizierung 
```

This means authentication is currently disabled for the `TranscribeAudioView` API endpoint, which should allow you to test your voice functionality without needing an authentication token. The endpoint will accept requests from any source without checking for authentication.

When you're done testing and ready for production, you can uncomment this line to re-enable authentication requirements.

# Missing FFmpeg Error Explanation

The error message indicates that your Django backend is unable to find the `ffmpeg` command when trying to process the audio file:

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ffmpeg'
```

## What's happening:

1. Your `convert_to_wav()` function in `voice/views.py` attempts to use `ffmpeg` to convert audio files to WAV format:
   ```python
   command = [
       'ffmpeg',  # This command is not found
       '-i', input_file_path,
       # other parameters...
   ]
   ```

2. The function calls `subprocess.run()` which tries to execute the `ffmpeg` command
   
3. Since `ffmpeg` is not installed in your Docker container, you get this error

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Install FFmpeg in your Docker container

Modify your Dockerfile to include FFmpeg:

```dockerfile
# Add this to your existing Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg
```

### Option 2: Create a temporary workaround for testing

If you want to test without rebuilding Docker, modify your view to handle the missing dependency:

```python
def convert_to_wav(input_file_path):
    """
    Converts an audio file to WAV format using ffmpeg.
    """
    try:
        # For testing purposes, just return the original file
        # Comment this out when you have ffmpeg installed
        logger.warning("FFmpeg not found - returning original file without conversion")
        return input_file_path
        
        # Create temporary directory for the conversion
        temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
        # Rest of your existing function...
```

### Option 3: Use a Docker image with FFmpeg pre-installed

Update your docker-compose.local.yml to use a Python image that includes FFmpeg:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    # Instead of build: .
    image: jrottenberg/ffmpeg:4.4-ubuntu  # This image has ffmpeg pre-installed
    # Rest of your configuration...
```

## Recommended Solution

The most straightforward approach is Option 1: adding FFmpeg to your Dockerfile. This ensures the dependency is always available in your container.

<user>
Please Check the attached files. I have added ffmpeg to the requirements list which should be used by docker. Look into the dockerfile

# FFmpeg Issue Analysis

I've reviewed your files, and I see the problem. There are two separate issues that need to be fixed:

## Issue 1: FFmpeg Python Package vs. System Binary

The `ffmpeg==1.4` in your requirements.txt is a **Python wrapper** for FFmpeg, not the actual FFmpeg binary that's needed to execute the commands in your code. Your error is occurring because the system command `ffmpeg` is not installed on your Docker container.

## Issue 2: Missing System Dependency

Your Docker container needs the actual FFmpeg binary installed at the system level.

## Solution

Here's how to fix it:

1. Modify your Dockerfile to install the FFmpeg system package:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.13.1-slim-bookworm

# Set environment variables to prevent Python from writing .pyc files to disc
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

WORKDIR /app 

# Install git and ffmpeg
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git ffmpeg && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY /backend/requirements.txt /tmp/

COPY /backend /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /tmp/requirements.txt

EXPOSE 8001

CMD ["uvicorn", "backend.asgi:application", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8001", "--reload"]
```

The important change is adding `ffmpeg` to the apt-get install command. This will install the actual FFmpeg binary that your `subprocess.run()` command is trying to execute.

After making this change, you'll need to rebuild your Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml build --no-cache
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up
```

This should properly install FFmpeg in your container and resolve the error.

where are the logs shown or saved?
</user>
<assistant>
# Where Logs Are Shown and Saved

Based on your project setup, logs in your Django application are handled in several ways:

## 1. Console Output
- When running your Docker containers with `docker-compose up`, logs are displayed in the terminal
- You can view container logs using: `docker logs backend-backend-1`
- Or follow the logs in real time: `docker logs -f backend-backend-1`

## 2. Log Files
- Your logs are saved to files in the `/Users/yanoh/Desktop/Notisent Dev/bknd/backend/logs/` directory
- You have several log files including:
  - `app.log` (current log)
  - `app.log.2025-08-06` (rotated logs from previous days)
  - `app.log.2025-09-26` (most recent rotated log)

## 3. Django Logger Configuration
- Your specific voice/STT logs use a logger named "stt":
  ```python
  logger = logging.getLogger("stt")
  ```
- These logs will be captured based on your Django logging configuration in settings.py

## 4. Docker Container Logs
- Docker captures all stdout/stderr output from your containers
- View all logs with: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs`
- Filter for specific service: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs backend`

To debug your current FFmpeg issue, I recommend:
1. Check the logs for any detailed error messages: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs backend`
2. Look at the most recent log file: `cat logs/app.log`
3. Ensure your container has been rebuilt after adding FFmpeg to the Dockerfile

how can i configure my django project to see the stt logger?
</user>
<assistant>
# Configuring the STT Logger in Django

I noticed your Django project already has a logging configuration, but it doesn't include a specific logger for your `stt` module. Here's how to add it:

## 1. Update Your Django Settings

Add this to your logging configuration in settings.py:

```python
LOGGING = {
    # ...existing configuration...
    
    # Define loggers to capture logs from different parts of your application
    "loggers": {
        # ...existing loggers...
        
        # Add this new logger for your STT module
        "stt": {
            "handlers": ["console", "file"],
            "level": "DEBUG",
            "propagate": False,
        },
    },
}
```

## 2. Check Your Usage in views.py

Your views.py file correctly defines:
```python
logger = logging.getLogger("stt")
```

## 3. Test Your Logger

To verify it's working, add this line at the beginning of your `TranscribeAudioView.post` method:

```python
def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    Handle audio file upload for transcription
    """
    logger.info("Received audio transcription request")
    try:
        # ...rest of your code
```

## 4. View the Logs

After making these changes and restarting your application:

1. **Check console output:**
   The logs will appear in your Docker container's console output.

2. **Check log files:**
   The logs will be saved to your log file at `/Users/yanoh/Desktop/Notisent Dev/bknd/backend/logs/app.log`.

3. **Filter logs with grep:**
   You can search for STT logs specifically with:
   ```bash
   docker logs backend-backend-1 | grep "stt"
   ```
   
   Or from the log file:
   ```bash
   grep "stt" /Users/yanoh/Desktop/Notisent Dev/bknd/backend/logs/app.log
   ```

Your `stt` logger will now capture all logs specifically from your voice transcription functionality.

I want to have propper logging, so i can see every step of the Process. For example if the file has been recieved, a task has been started and so on. 
</user>
<assistant>
# Voice Functionality Implementation Review

I've reviewed your audio transcription implementation, and while the main functionality is in place, there are opportunities to improve the logging. Here's my analysis and recommendations:

## What's Working ‚úÖ

1. **Basic Flow**: Your endpoint correctly:
   - Receives audio files
   - Validates file types
   - Converts to WAV format
   - Queues the transcription task

2. **Error Handling**: You have good error handling for file conversion and request processing

3. **Logging Setup**: The `stt` logger is properly configured in settings.py

## Logging Improvements Needed üìù

Your code doesn't log enough information to track the entire process. Let's add comprehensive logging:

```python
def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    Handle audio file upload for transcription
    """
    logger.info("Received audio file transcription request")
    try:
        # Extract the audio file from the request
        audio_file = request.FILES.get('audio_file')
        
        if not audio_file:
            logger.warning("No audio file provided in request")
            return Response(
                {"error": "No audio file provided"},
                status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST
            )
            
        # Check file extension (optional - can be extended with more formats)
        allowed_extensions = ['.mp3', '.wav', '.m4a', '.ogg', '.flac']
        file_ext = os.path.splitext(audio_file.name)[1].lower()
        
        logger.info(f"Processing audio file: {audio_file.name} ({file_ext}) - size: {audio_file.size} bytes")

        transcription = AudioTranscription.objects.create(
            #user=request.user,
            audio_file=audio_file,
            status='pending'
        )

        if process.returncode != 0:
            error_output = process.stderr.decode()
            logger.error(f"Error converting audio file: {error_output}")
            raise Exception(f"Failed to convert audio: {error_output}")
        
        logger.info(f"Audio conversion successful - output: {output_path}")
        return output_path
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in convert_to_wav: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
        raise
```

## Testing the Implementation

To test your functionality:

1. Send a POST request to `/api/stt/transcribe/` with an audio file
2. Monitor the logs in real-time using:
   ```bash
   docker logs -f backend-backend-1
   ```
   
3. Or check the log file:
   ```bash
   cat /Users/yanoh/Desktop/Notisent\ Dev/bknd/backend/logs/app.log
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Check Task Implementation**: Make sure your `transcribe_audio` task in `tasks.py` also includes proper logging
2. **Consider Status Updates**: Add more status updates to track progress through the pipeline
3. **Add Monitoring**: Consider adding metrics to track audio processing times and success rates

By implementing these changes, you'll have comprehensive logging that tracks every step of the audio processing pipeline.

# Code Review: Audio Transcription Processing

Looking at your Django REST Framework view code, I notice several issues:

## Logic Flow Issue

```python
transcription.save()
return Response(
    {"error": "Failed to convert audio file to WAV format"},
    status=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
)
```

There's a logical error here - you're saving the transcription object and then immediately returning an error response. This code is unreachable or incorrectly structured.

## Type Checker Errors

The German error messages indicate type checking issues:
- List objects being called as functions
- Missing or unrecognized attributes (like `id` on `AudioTranscription`)
- Unknown attributes like `__call__`

## Security Concern

```python
class TranscriptionWebhookView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [AllowAny]  # Consider securing this with a token or signature verification
```

The comment correctly identifies a security concern - this webhook endpoint is accessible to anyone. You should implement proper authentication for this endpoint.

## Recommendations:

1. Fix the logic flow with the error response
2. Add type annotations to help the type checker
3. Ensure your models have proper definitions
4. Implement security for your webhook

Would you like me to suggest specific code changes for any of these issues?

<user>
where is this message implemented: "POST /api/stt/transcribe/ HTTP/1.1" 202 Accepted
</user>
<assistant>
The message `"POST /api/stt/transcribe/ HTTP/1.1" 202 Accepted` is a server access log entry that's automatically generated by your web server (likely Uvicorn or Django's built-in development server).

It's produced when your `TranscribeAudioView.post` method successfully processes a request and returns a 202 Accepted response:

```python
return Response(
    {
        "message": "Audio file uploaded successfully and transcription initiated",
        "transcription": serializer.data
    },
    status=status.HTTP_202_ACCEPTED  # This is what generates the 202 Accepted status
)
```

This part of your code is correctly implemented. The 202 status code is appropriate for this situation because it indicates that:

1. The request was valid
2. Processing has been accepted but is not yet complete
3. The transcription will happen asynchronously

This status code is perfect for your workflow since you're using Celery to process the audio transcription in the background with `transcribe_audio.delay()`.

The URL path `/api/stt/transcribe/` is defined in your URLs configuration file, which maps to this view.

# Type Checking Error Analysis

The error message you're seeing is coming from a static type checker (likely Pylance/Pyright in VSCode), not a runtime Python error. Let's fix this:

## Primary Issue

The error `Das Objekt vom Typ "list[str]" kann nicht aufgerufen werden` (Object of type "list[str]" cannot be called) indicates that your type checker thinks `transcribe_audio` is a list rather than a callable task.

## Solution

Add proper type annotations for Celery tasks:

```python
# At the top of your file with other imports
from celery import shared_task
from typing import Any, Union, Optional
```

Then add a type annotation for your task:

```python
# Above your class definitions
transcribe_audio: Any  # Or more specifically for Celery tasks
```

## For the AudioTranscription.id issue

The type checker doesn't recognize the Django model's automatic ID field. Add a stub or type hint:

```python
# In your models.py or add this type stub
class AudioTranscription:
    id: int  # Type hint for the ID field
    # other field definitions
```

## Other Unused Import Warnings

The other warnings about unused imports can be fixed by:
1. Removing unused imports
2. Adding `# noqa` comments where imports are used indirectly 
3. Adding `# type: ignore` for imports used by the type system

These changes will help your type checker understand your code's structure without changing runtime behavior.

# Detailed Explanation of tasks.py File

## Overview
The tasks.py file defines a Celery task that handles audio transcription by sending files to a speech-to-text service running in a Docker container. This allows your application to process audio files asynchronously without blocking the main application thread.

## Function Parameters

```python
@shared_task(base=TenantAwareTask, queue="bulk")
def transcribe_audio(transcription_id, tenant_id, ms_user_id):
```

The task accepts three parameters:

1. **`transcription_id`**: The database ID of the `AudioTranscription` record to process
   - Used to retrieve the specific audio file that needs transcription
   - Allows the task to update the same record with results when finished

2. **`tenant_id`**: The ID of the tenant in your multi-tenant application
   - Required for row-level security in multi-tenant applications
   - Ensures data isolation between different organizations/clients
   - Passed from the view where it's extracted with `request.tenant.id`

3. **`ms_user_id`**: The Microsoft user ID of the user who initiated the request
   - Used for attribution (tracking who requested the transcription)
   - Helps with audit logs and permissions
   - Extracted in the view from `request.user.id`

## Task Configuration

- **`@shared_task`**: Marks this function as a Celery task that can be executed asynchronously
- **`base=TenantAwareTask`**: Uses a custom task class that implements tenant isolation
- **`queue="bulk"`**: Routes this task to a specific queue for resource-intensive operations

## Task Execution Flow

1. **Set Row-Level Security Context**:
   ```python
   transcribe_audio.set_rls(tenant_id, ms_user_id)
   ```
   This configures the database session to respect tenant boundaries.

2. **Retrieve Transcription Record**:
   ```python
   transcription = AudioTranscription.objects.get(id=transcription_id)
   ```
   Fetches the database record using the ID passed from the view.

3. **Update Status and Get File Path**:
   ```python
   transcription.status = 'processing'
   transcription.save()
   file_path = transcription.audio_file.path
   ```

4. **Send to Transcription Service**:
   ```python
   response = requests.post(
       "http://localhost:8000/transcribe/file",
       files={'file': audio_file}
   )
   ```
   The file is sent to your speech-to-text service container.

5. **Process Results**:
   - On success: Updates record with transcribed text
   - On failure: Records error information

## Why These Parameters Are Handed Over

These parameters represent the **minimum necessary information** to:

1. Locate the correct audio file (`transcription_id`)
2. Maintain proper multi-tenancy security (`tenant_id`) 
3. Track the requesting user for auditing/permissions (`ms_user_id`)

Passing just these IDs (rather than entire objects) follows best practices for Celery tasks because:
- IDs are small and serializable
- It avoids potential stale data issues
- It respects database transaction boundaries

This task design pattern keeps your application scalable and maintainable while ensuring proper data isolation between tenants.

# Fixing the Celery Task Type Error

The error message indicates that your type checker thinks `transcribe_audio` is a list of strings rather than a Celery task with methods.

## Solution for `set_rls` Method Type Error

To fix this, add a proper type annotation at the top of your tasks.py file:

```python
# Add to the top of tasks.py
from typing import Any, Optional, Union
from celery import shared_task

# Type annotation for your Celery task
transcribe_audio: Any  # This tells the type checker that transcribe_audio can have any methods
```

## Alternative: Declare Custom Task Class

For a more precise solution, you could define the task type properly:

```python
# tasks.py
from celery import Task
from typing import Protocol, Optional

class TranscribeTask(Protocol):
    """Protocol defining the structure of our transcribe_audio task"""
    def delay(self, transcription_id: int, tenant_id: Optional[int], ms_user_id: int) -> Any: ...
    def set_rls(self, tenant_id: Optional[int], ms_user_id: int) -> None: ...

# Then annotate your task
transcribe_audio: TranscribeTask
```

These type annotations will help your type checker understand that `transcribe_audio` has both the standard Celery `delay` method and your custom `set_rls` method.

The annotations won't change runtime behavior but will eliminate the type checking errors.

# Celery Task Call - Critical Error Analysis

The code you've highlighted contains a serious bug that will prevent your audio transcription from working properly:

```python
transcribe_audio.delay(
    """
    transcription_id=transcription.id,
    tenant_id=tenant_id,
    ms_user_id=ms_user_id
    """
)
```

## The Problem

You're passing a **multiline string** to the Celery task instead of actual parameters. This means:

1. The task will receive a **single string argument** instead of the three parameters it expects
2. The string contains Python-like syntax, but it's just text, not executable code
3. Your task will fail because it can't access `transcription_
</assistant>
<user>
where does the audiofile get converted into a wav file?
</user>
<assistant>
# Analysis of Your Audio Task Code

There's a significant issue with your Celery task invocation:

```python
# INCORRECT CODE - This is passing a single string instead of parameters
transcribe_audio.delay(
    """
    transcription_id=transcription.id,
    tenant_id=tenant_id,
    ms_user_id=ms_user_id
    """
)
```

## The Problem

You're passing a **multi-line string literal** to the `delay()` method, not actual parameters. This means:

1. Your task is receiving a single string parameter
2. None of your actual data (IDs) is being sent to the task
3. This will cause the task to fail when it tries to use these values

## How It Should Be Written

```python
# CORRECT CODE
transcribe_audio.delay(
    transcription_id=transcription.id,
    tenant_id=tenant_id,
    ms_user_id=ms_user_id
)
```

## Audio File Conversion

Regarding your question about WAV conversion:

The audio file is converted to WAV format earlier in your code, in the section that begins with:

```python
if file_ext.lower() != '.wav':
    try:
        # Convert to WAV format
        wav_file_path = convert_to_wav(input_file_path)
        # ...
```

This happens before the task is queued. The conversion uses the `convert_to_wav()` function (which probably uses ffmpeg) to ensure the audio is in WAV format before it's sent for transcription.

This approach is correct because:
1. It's better to convert once on the server side
2. The STT service expects a specific format
3. Converting before queuing ensures the task works with a consistent format

@workspace /explain Write an explanation for the active selection as paragraphs of text.

```python
{process.stdout.decode()}
```


</user>
<assistant>
# Understanding `{process.stdout.decode()}`

This code snippet is accessing the standard output (stdout) from a process object and converting the raw bytes data to a human-readable string.

When Python executes external processes (typically using the `subprocess` module), the output is captured as bytes. The `decode()` method converts these bytes to a string using UTF-8 encoding by default.

This pattern is commonly used when:

1. Running command-line tools or external programs from Python
2. Needing to capture and process the text output from those programs
3. Working with system commands that produce text results

For example, this might be part of a function that runs FFmpeg to convert audio files, capturing the conversion logs or metadata information. Without the `.decode()` call, you would get raw bytes (`b'output text'`) instead of a proper string that can be displayed or processed.

The code is likely part of a larger function that executes an external process and then uses its output as part of the Django view's response or for logging purposes.
</assistant>
<user>
@workspace /explain Write an explanation for the active selection as paragraphs of text.

```python
logger.info(f"ffmpeg stdout: {process.stdout.decode()}")
```


</user>
<assistant>
# Understanding `logger.info(f"ffmpeg stdout: {process.stdout.decode()}")`

This line of code serves a critical logging function in a process that involves running the FFmpeg multimedia framework. Let's break down what's happening:

The code is capturing the standard output from an FFmpeg command execution and recording it in the application logs. When FFmpeg (or any external program) runs via Python's `subprocess` module, its output is captured as raw bytes rather than as a string.

The `process.stdout.decode()` call converts these bytes into a human-readable string using UTF-8 encoding (the default encoding for the `decode()` method). Without this decoding step, the log would contain unreadable byte representation rather than actual text.

The entire message is formatted using an f-string, combining the static text "ffmpeg stdout: " with the decoded output, and passed to `logger.info()`, which records this information at the INFO log level. This logging is particularly valuable for debugging purposes, as it allows developers to see exactly what FFmpeg reported during its execution without having to directly observe the command-line output.

In audio/video processing pipelines, having these logs can be crucial for diagnosing conversion issues, codec problems, or other media processing errors.

# Understanding the Django Model ID Type Error

The error message indicates that your type checker doesn't recognize the `id` attribute on the `AudioTranscription` model. This is a common issue with static type checkers and Django models.

## Why This Happens

Django automatically creates an `id` field as the primary key for models that don't explicitly define another primary key. However, static type checkers can't detect these dynamically created attributes.

## How to Fix It

You can add type annotations to help your type checker understand Django's ORM:

```python
# In models.py
from django.db import models
from typing import Any

class AudioTranscription(models.Model):
    id: int  # Type hint for the auto-generated primary key
    # Your other fields
    
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f"Transcription {self.id}"
```

## Alternative Solution

For a more comprehensive solution, you could use Django-specific type stubs:

```python
# Install django-stubs package
# pip install django-stubs

# Then in your mypy.ini or setup.cfg
# [mypy]
# plugins = mypy_django_plugin.main
# 
# [mypy.plugins.django-stubs]
# django_settings_module = "your_project.settings"
```

This will provide proper type information for all Django-related code, including model attributes.

# Debug Log Source Analysis

The debug message you're seeing is from Celery's internals, specifically its function serialization process. This is not your actual code, but rather Celery's representation of your task.

## Where to Find This in Your Code:

This corresponds to your task definition in `voice/tasks.py`:

```python
@shared_task(base=TenantAwareTask, queue="bulk")
def transcribe_audio(transcription_id, tenant_id, ms_user_id):
    """
    Task to transcribe an audio file using an external service.
    """
    #transcribe_audio.set_rls(tenant_id, ms_user_id)
    logger.info(f"Starting transcription task for transcription ID: {transcription_id}, tenant_id: {tenant_id}, ms_user_id: {ms_user_id}")
    
    # ... rest of your implementation
```

## What's Happening:

1. The log entry is from `celery.utils.functional` module
2. Celery is inspecting your task function during registration
3. It's creating a simplified representation for serialization
4. The `return 1` is a placeholder Celery uses internally

This debug message is part of Celery's internal task registration process, not an error. It's showing how Celery "sees" your function signature during the task registration phase.

You don't need to change anything in your code - this is normal Celery behavior when it's registering tasks at startup.

# Getting Logs from Inside Celery Shared Tasks

## How to Log from Tasks

You're already set up correctly with:

```python
# In tasks.py
logger = logging.getLogger("stt_task")

@shared_task(base=TenantAwareTask, queue="bulk")
def transcribe_audio(transcription_id, tenant_id, ms_user_id):
    logger.info(f"Starting transcription task for ID: {transcription_id}")
    # ...
```

To add more detailed logging:

```python
# Add context-rich logs
logger.debug(f"Processing audio file at path: {file_path}")
logger.info(f"Task completed successfully in {elapsed_time}s")
logger.error(f"Transcription failed: {str(error)}", exc_info=True)
```

## Where Logs Are Displayed

Celery task logs appear in several places:

1. **Celery Worker Terminal**:
   - If you run the Celery worker directly, logs appear in its terminal
   - Command: `celery -A backend worker -l INFO`

2. **Docker Container Logs**:
   - Since you're using Docker, check the celery_worker container:
   ```bash
   docker logs backend-celery_worker-1
   ```

3. **Log Files**:
   - Your logs are saved to `/Users/yanoh/Desktop/Notisent Dev/bknd/backend/logs/app.log`
   - Search for "stt_task" to find your specific logger's output:
   ```bash
   grep "stt_task" logs/app.log
   ```

4. **Celery Flower** (if configured):
   - Flower is a web UI for Celery that shows task progress and logs
   - Add to docker-compose: 
   ```yaml
   flower:
     image: mher/flower
     ports:
       - "5555:5555"
     environment:
       - CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
   ```

## Improving Task Logging

For better task tracking:

1. **Include task_id in logs**:
   ```python
   @shared_task(bind=True)  # Add bind=True
   def transcribe_audio(self, transcription_id, tenant_id, ms_user_id):
       logger.info(f"Task {self.request.id}: Starting transcription {transcription_id}")
   ```

2. **Add structured logging**:
   ```python
   logger.info("Transcription completed", extra={
       "task_id": self.request.id,
       "transcription_id": transcription_id,
       "duration_ms": processing_time,
   })
   ```

These methods will help you effectively track and debug your Celery tasks through their lifecycle.

# Sending Requests to Your STT Container

To send requests to your running STT container, you need to make HTTP POST requests to `http://localhost:8080/transcribe/file`. Here's how to do this:

## Python Example Using requests Library

```python
import requests

def send_audio_to_stt(audio_file_path):
    """
    Send audio file to STT container for transcription.
    
    Args:
        audio_file_path: Path to the audio file to transcribe
        
    Returns:
        Transcription response from the service
    """
    url = "http://localhost:8080/transcribe/file"
    
    # Open the file in binary mode
    with open(audio_file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
        # Create a dictionary with the file to be uploaded
        files = {'file': audio_file}
        
        # Send the POST request
        response = requests.post(url, files=files)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
```

## Integration with Your Django Task

You can modify your `transcribe_audio` task to use this:

```python
@shared_task(base=TenantAwareTask, queue="bulk")
def transcribe_audio(transcription_id, tenant_id, ms_user_id):
    """Task to transcribe an audio file using the STT container."""
    logger.info(f"Starting transcription task for ID: {transcription_id}")
    
    try:
        # Get the transcription record
        transcription = AudioTranscription.objects.get(id=transcription_id)
        
        # Get the file path
        file_path = transcription.audio_file.path
        
        # Send to STT container
        url = "http://localhost:8080/transcribe/file"
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
            files = {'file': audio_file}
            response = requests.post(url, files=files)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            result = response.json()
            
            # Update the transcription with the result
            transcription.transcription_text = result.get('text', '')
            transcription.status = 'completed'
            transcription.save()
            
            logger.info(f"Transcription completed successfully for ID: {transcription_id}")
            return True
        else:
            logger.error(f"STT service error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
            transcription.status = 'failed'
            transcription.error_message = f"STT service error: {response.status_code}"
            transcription.save()
            return False
            
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in transcription task: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
        # Update status to failed
        if 'transcription' in locals():
            transcription.status = 'failed'
            transcription.error_message = str(e)
            transcription.save()
        return False
```

## Testing the Connection

You can test if the STT container is responding correctly with:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@/path/to/your/audio.wav" http://localhost:8080/transcribe/file
```

Make sure the STT container is accessible from wherever your Django application is running (especially important in Docker environments, where you might need to use the Docker network).

</user>
<assistant>
# Communicating with Docker Containers Outside the Network

Yes, you can send requests to a Docker container that's not inside the same container network in several ways:

## 1. Using Host Network as Bridge

Since you've already published port 8080 with this command:
```bash
docker run --name stt-container -d -p 8080:8000 stt-service
```

You can access this container:

- **From the host machine**: Using `http://localhost:8080/transcribe/file`
- **From another container**: Using the host machine as a bridge

## 2. From Another Container to Your STT Container

If your Django container needs to reach the STT container:

```python
# In your Django container code
import requests

# NOT localhost - use host.docker.internal on Mac/Windows
url = "http://host.docker.internal:8080/transcribe/file"

# For Linux hosts, you need to add this to your docker run command:
# --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway
```

## 3. Create a Custom Network (Better Approach)

```bash
# Create a network
docker network create stt-network

# Connect existing containers
docker network connect stt-network stt-container
docker network connect stt-network your-django-container

# Now in your Django code, use the container name as hostname
url = "http://stt-container:8000/transcribe/file"  # Use internal port
```

## 4. Docker Compose Solution

If using docker-compose, add the STT service:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    # ...existing config
    
  stt-service:
    image: stt-service
    container_name: stt-container
    ports:
      - "8080:8000"
      
  # Now backend can access stt-service at http://stt-service:8000
```

This last option is the most maintainable for development and production.
